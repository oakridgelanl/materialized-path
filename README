ActsAsMaterializedPath
======================

This plugin implements a set of trees (nested set) in a single table.

Within its limitations, this plugin is meant to be more efficient than
existing implementations of nested sets.


Example
=======

In the class implementing the trees:

acts_as_materialized_path :delimiter => '.',
            		  :base => 36,
            		  :column => 'materialized_path',
            		  :places => 3,


In the migration file, ensure the path_column_name is not null and has
a unique index:

  t.string :materialized_path, :null => false

  add_index(:tree_table, [:materialized_path], :unique => true)


In addition, the collating sequence for ascii representable characters
must be ascii.
